## 2026-06-15 - Match Analysis Tab Bug Fixes & Previews Resiliency Completed

Prepared by: Orchestrator

### Current Objective

Ensure correct group standings sorting, dynamic knockout bracket updates from API, and fully automated, resilient match previews and tactical comparisons without crashes or empty views on the dashboard.

### Completed This Update

- **Standings Parsing & Sorting**: Corrected the parsing of groups from the API and sorted standings descending by points (`pts`), then goal difference (`gd`), then goals for (`gf`).
- **Dynamic API-Driven Bracket**: Configured bracket rounds mapping to the live `/get/games` schedule. Bracket advances teams and scores automatically in real time.
- **AI Match Previews & Resiliency**: Resolved the `KeyError: 'team_metrics'` crash in the Streamlit app. Configured the generation pipeline to write the `team_metrics` block containing ELO and FBref statistics for both teams.
- **New Team Profiles & Rosters**: Populated static rosters, club affiliations, and tournament standings for 8 new teams (Spain, Cape Verde, Belgium, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Uruguay, Iran, New Zealand) and handled spelling normalization for Côte d'Ivoire.
- **Expanded upcoming games coverage**: Increased upcoming preview limits from 3 to 8 matches, resolving the missing **Iran vs New Zealand** fixture on June 15, 2026.
- **Cloud Run Deployment**: Rebuilt the Docker container and redeployed the live dashboard.
- **Tournament Board Standing Update Fix**: Installed `curl` inside the slim Docker container image to resolve the silent failure of runtime standings API calls, and updated the local `grid_state.json` fallback.
- **Portfolio Website Integration**: Synchronized the React routing changes and whitelisted the CSP `frame-src` in `.htaccess` on the remote server via SSH.

### Next Sprint Priorities

- None. Project is complete and in maintenance mode.
